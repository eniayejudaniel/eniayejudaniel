## **Introduction**

Hello! My name is **Daniel Eniayeju**. A passionate, results-oriented data scientist with expertise in leveraging data to generate actionable insights and solve complex business problems. With a broad background in statistics, programming, and machine learning, I excel at extracting valuable information from data and communicating it clearly and meaningfully. 

## **Skills**

**Data Analysis:** I have a solid knowledge of exploratory data analysis, statistical modeling, and hypothesis testing. I can clean and preprocess data, perform descriptive and inferential statistical analysis, and identify patterns and trends. 

**Machine Learning:** I have mastered the development and implementation of machine learning algorithms for predictive modeling, and classification. I have experience with self-supervised learning. My expertise in self-supervised learning includes Pretext Task Design, Encoder Architecture, Data Augmentation, and Deep Learning.

**Computer Vision:** I have expertise in computer vision techniques for object detection (fire Scene) I am familiar with OpenCV, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and other frameworks, and I have applied computer vision algorithms such as YOLO (You Only Look Once) to detect fire scene. 

**Natural Language Processing (NLP):**
I have knowledge and experience with NLP techniques such as text preprocessing, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, topic modeling, and text classification. I have used libraries such as NLTK, SpaCy, and Gensim to develop models for tasks such as text summarization, sentiment analysis, and chatbot development.

**Data Visualization:**
I have strong data visualization skills and use tools such as Python libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, etc.) to create insightful and visually appealing charts, graphs, and dashboards. I can effectively convey complex information in a visually appealing and easy-to-understand way.

**Programming:**
I am proficient in programming languages such as Python and R, which I use frequently for data manipulation, analysis, and model development. I'm familiar with libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc., and I'm always up to date with the latest tools and technologies in this space.

**Web Scraping:** 
I possess strong web scraping skills and can extract data from websites using Python, and libraries like Beautiful Soup, Selenium, and Scrapy. I can handle pagination, user-agent rotation, and proxies to collect data from various web sources efficiently.


**Data Storytelling:**
I have excellent communication and presentation skills and can effectively communicate complex concepts and insights to technical and non-technical audiences. Turn complex analysis into actionable recommendations and deliver data-driven insights to guide your decisions.
